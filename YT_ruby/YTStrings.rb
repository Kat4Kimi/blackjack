# Strings are basically plain text data
# Methods are a block of code we can call - you can modify or give us info about our string

# p

phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
puts "programming" .upcase()
# puts phrase.index("ffe") This tells me what charectar the ffe starts in.
# puts phrase [0,3] This will print Gir - it won't include the 3rd charectar

# puts phrase[0] This would print out the letter in the "0" charectar

# puts phrase.include? "Academy" # This will give you a True or False letting us know whether Academy was included in string


# Functions are something we call that can call to modify our string or they'll give us info about our string
# .strip takes all extra spaces out of it
