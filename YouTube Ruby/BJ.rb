The initial card is 52. Make sure there are no duplicate cards when drawing

Two-player battle between the player and the dealer. Player is the executor, dealer is the executor automatically

At the beginning of the run, the player and the dealer each draw two cards. The drawn card is displayed on the screen. However, do not know the dealer's second card

After that, the player draws the card first. If the player exceeds 21, it bursts and the player loses, at which point the game ends

Each time a player draws a card, he or she can choose to draw the next card.

Once the player has finished drawing, the dealer will continue to draw until his or her hand is 17 or higher.

The game is played when the player and the dealer finish drawing. The one closer to 21 wins

Treat J, Q and K as 10

A is treated only as "1" for the time being. Do not set to "11"

No double down, no split, no surrender, no other special rules
