# Hashes let you store key value pairs. You can store a value and give it a key. Hashes act a lot like dictionaries. In addition to the word you have the definition. Word = Key and Value - definition.

states = {
	:Pennsylvania => "PA", 
	2 => "NY",
	"Oregon" => "OR"

}

# puts states["Oregon"] This will print out OR

# HOW IS A HASH DIFFERENT THAN ARRAY? I CAN GIVE HASHES A KEY AND IT WILL SPIT OUT A VALUE
