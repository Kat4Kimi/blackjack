# To manually add a new line you can use the charectar "\n" 
# There is also a tab charectar ("\t")

# print "hello\n"
# print "\tworld\n"

# the code above prints:
# hello
# 	world

# puts "hello"
# puts "world"
#the code above would print:
# hello
# world

# p prints data to the screen with a new line but also gives information on type of data that was printed:
# p "hello"
# p 'goodbye'
# p "42"
# p 42

# p method shows the quotes on all that have quotes whether double or single. The 42 was printed as just 42, no quotes.
